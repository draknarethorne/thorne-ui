# Phase 6: Inventory Windows Research — Archive Index

**Status:** ✅ Completed & Archived (February 4-16, 2026)

**Archive Location:** `.development/archive/initial-phases/phase-6-inventory-research/`

## What Was in Phase 6

Phase 6 was a comprehensive research initiative to analyze existing EQ UI inventory implementations across multiple community variants, with the goal of informing the design of a legendary, player-first inventory system for Thorne UI v0.6.x and beyond.

### Key Research Documents

**Analysis Reports** (Community UI Comparisons):
- `INVENTORY-ANALYSIS-DEFAULT.md` - Baseline EverQuest client patterns and structure
- `INVENTORY-ANALYSIS-DUXAUI.md` - Advanced stat icons, compact layout analysis
- `INVENTORY-ANALYSIS-QQ.md` - Dense grid layouts, two-column organization
- `INVENTORY-ANALYSIS-INFINITI-BLUE.md` - Texture atlas and color palette approaches
- `INVENTORY-ANALYSIS-VERT.md` - Narrow width optimization techniques
- `INVENTORY-ANALYSIS-ZEAL.md` - Enhanced EQTypes and client extensions
- `INVENTORY-ANALYSIS-NEMESIS.md` - Integrated stat displays
- `INVENTORY-ANALYSIS-QQQUARM.md` - Percentage displays, three-column layouts
- `INVENTORY-ANALYSIS-THORNE-DEV.md` - Current Thorne UI experimental approach
- `INVENTORY-CURRENT-STATE-ANALYSIS.md` - Thorne v0.6.x baseline status
- `INVENTORY-LAYOUT-COMPARISON.md` - Synthesis of layout patterns

**Design & Recommendation Documents**:
- `INVENTORY-REDESIGN-RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - 4,500+ word analysis with proposals
- `ZONE-BALANCE-ANALYSIS.md` - Height calculations and layout optimization
- `INVENTORY-REORGANIZATION-DECISIONS.md` - Strategic decisions on organization
- `INVENTORY-REDESIGN-FINAL-PLAN.md` - Shipping implementation roadmap
- `INVENTORY-REDESIGN-FINAL.md` - Final design specification
- `INVENTORY-REDESIGN-MODULAR-FINAL.md` - Modular component approach

**Project Management**:
- `ANALYSIS-PROJECT-ROADMAP.md` - Research execution timeline
- `RESEARCH-FINDINGS-Q1-Q3.md` - Key discoveries and action items
- `SESSION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Final session summary

## Why Archived

Phase 6 research was **completed successfully** and informed the inventory improvements shipped in:
- **v0.6.0** ✅ Major inventory UI overhaul (February 6, 2026)
- **v0.6.5** ✅ Spellbook polish and options enhancements (February 18, 2026)

Current development focus is **v0.7.0** (spell recast timers, QoL enhancements, stat icons), which builds upon Phase 6 research but does not require active reference to historical analysis documents.

**Key achievements from Phase 6 research:**
- ✅ Identified 8+ community inventory approaches
- ✅ Synthesized best practices (compact layouts, stat integration, accessibility)
- ✅ Defined modular component patterns
- ✅ Created roadmap for staged inventory improvements
- ✅ Established legendary visual and functional standards
