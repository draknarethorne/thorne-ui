# Thorne UI v0.4.0 Release Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from the v0.4.0 release (February 2, 2026) - **the first official release** with GitHub Releases infrastructure.

## Contents

- **RELEASE-v0.4.0-READY.md** - Pre-release checklist and deployment readiness assessment
- **RELEASE-v0.4.0-INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Complete step-by-step instructions for creating and pushing the v0.4.0 tag
- **MERGE-AND-RELEASE-INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Instructions for merging the release infrastructure PR
- **RELEASE-SUMMARY.md** - Summary of all preparation work completed for v0.4.0

## What v0.4.0 Included

**Major Features:**
- ✅ GitHub Releases infrastructure with automated workflows
- ✅ Automated ZIP packaging on GitHub Actions
- ✅ Public Releases page (`/releases` URL)
- ✅ Testing suite and validation scripts
- ✅ Comprehensive release documentation

## Key Note

**v0.4.0 documentation is verbose** because it was building the entire release infrastructure from scratch. Future releases (v0.5.0+) use a streamlined process documented in the parent `releases/` directory.

## For v0.5.0 and Beyond

The generic release process is now established. See:
- **[.docs/releases/INDEX.md](../../../.docs/releases/INDEX.md)** - Release documentation index
- **[.docs/releases/RELEASES-QUICKSTART.md](../../../.docs/releases/RELEASES-QUICKSTART.md)** - Quick reference guide
- **[RELEASE-TEMPLATE.md](../../../.docs/releases/RELEASE-TEMPLATE.md)** - Template for future releases
