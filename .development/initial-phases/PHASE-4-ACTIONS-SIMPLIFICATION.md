# Phase 4: Actions Window Simplification

**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Priority**: Medium (post-Phase 3.9 completion)  
**Target Completion**: TBD

## Objectives

- Evaluate if Actions window should contain less functionality
- Reduce visual clutter while maintaining access to key features
- Investigate alternative window placements for secondary features

## Planned Enhancements

- Simplify Main tab (currently: 8 buttons + stats)
- Consider consolidating buttons
- Explore separating combat info to Character window
- Test impact on overall UI footprint

## Constraints

- Must maintain access to core actions (camp, sit, stand, melee, ranged)
- Must preserve inventory tab access
- Must keep player stats visible (HP/Mana for raid awareness)

## Design Questions

1. **Stats Display**: Should stats move entirely to Phase 3.9 Inventory character sheet?
2. **Button Density**: Are all current buttons necessary, or can some be consolidated?
3. **Tab Structure**: Should Actions window remain tabbed, or move to single-page design?
4. **Window Size**: Can we reduce overall footprint while maintaining usability?

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Reduced visual complexity without losing functionality
- ✅ Improved scanning/readability of essential information
- ✅ Consistent with overall UI aesthetic and patterns
- ✅ User testing validates simplified layout improves workflow
